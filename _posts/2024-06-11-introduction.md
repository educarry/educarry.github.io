## Welcome to the Educarry Blog

Hello everyone,

I'm thrilled to introduce you to Educarry, a nonprofit initiative aimed at revolutionizing the way community college students in California navigate their academic journeys. Whether you're aiming to transfer to a public university or juggling classes across multiple community colleges, Educarry is here to simplify and enhance your experience.

### Background and Vision

Our primary focus is on community college students who are planning to transfer to public universities in California. Many of these students, especially those with ambitions to apply to multiple institutions or who need to complete various lower division courses across different community colleges, face significant challenges. The existing tools, like ASSIST, provide some guidance but often fall short when it comes to quickly and efficiently creating a comprehensive class plan that spans multiple colleges.

### Purpose and Objectives

Educarry is designed to address these gaps. Our project aims to be more than just a supplementary tool to ASSIST; it aims to surpass it. We offer features that allow students to build detailed class plans that span multiple community colleges, ensuring that every required course is accounted for. This is particularly crucial for students aiming for competitive majors or considering double majors and alternative majors.

### The Significance of Educarry

The reality for many students is that community colleges might not offer all the courses needed for a specific major's lower division requirements. This means students often need to piece together a plan from multiple colleges, a task that can be daunting and time-consuming. Educarry alleviates this burden by providing a centralized platform where students can find and plan their coursework efficiently. This project is poised to improve upon some of ASSIST's features by allowing searches and class planning across all 100+ community colleges in California.

### Project Scope and Deliverables

Educarry will provide a user-friendly interface that consolidates crucial information on course articulation and transferability. Our deliverables include a comprehensive, searchable database of community college courses, articulation agreements, and a planning tool that helps students map out their academic paths seamlessly. The ultimate goal is to offer an intuitive platform that makes course selection and transfer planning straightforward and stress-free.

### Approach and Methodology

Our approach involves thorough research and data integration. We will collect articulation agreements and course equivalency data from various sources and validate them to ensure accuracy. The methodology includes scraping data from ASSIST's API and integrating it into a centralized database, providing students with reliable and up-to-date information.

### Project Management and Timeline

The project will be managed through a collaborative model with regular progress updates. Key milestones include database development, UI design, integration of articulation agreements, and rigorous testing. We aim to complete these milestones within two months, ensuring a swift yet thorough development process.

### Benefits and Value Proposition

Educarry offers significant benefits, including time and cost savings for students. By providing a streamlined process for course selection and transfer planning, students can avoid the pitfalls of retaking courses or extending their academic timelines. The platform's ease of use and comprehensive information will empower students to make informed decisions about their education.

### Next Steps

With your support and interest, we are eager to move forward and bring Educarry to life. If you have any questions or need further information, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for joining us on this journey to make higher education more accessible and manageable for community college students in California. Stay tuned for updates and more exciting developments from Educarry!
